    "### Background Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "While researching how cryptographic hash functions work, I came across an article called [*Cryptography Hash Method MD2 (Message Digest 2) – Step-by-Step Explanation Made Easy with Python*](https://nickthecrypt.medium.com/cryptography-hash-method-md2-message-digest-2-step-by-step-explanation-made-easy-with-python-10faa2e35e85) by Nick The Crypt. Although that article focuses on the older MD2 algorithm, it helped me understand the overall logic behind hash functions how they mix and transform bits to make outputs unpredictable. MD2 and SHA-256 are quite different in their design (MD2 uses substitution tables, while SHA-256 relies on logical operations and rotations), but the core idea of achieving diffusion and non-reversibility is the same. Reading it gave me a better appreciation for why SHA-256 uses helper functions like `Ch`, `Maj`, and the Σ/σ functions I implemented here.\n"

    "The functions below form the mathematical backbone of cryptographic hash algorithms like SHA-256.  \n",
    "They rely on **bitwise operations** that manipulate the binary representation of 32-bit integers to create diffusion (mixing of input bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **_rotr(x, n):**  \n",
    "   This function performs a *bitwise rotation* of a 32-bit integer `x` to the right by `n` positions.  \n",
    "   Unlike a normal shift, the bits that “fall off” on the right side are wrapped around to the left side.  \n",
    "   This operation preserves all bits while changing their order an important property for reversible bit mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parity(x, y, z):**  \n",
    "   This computes the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of three values.  \n",
    "   Each bit in the result is 1 if an odd number of corresponding bits among `x`, `y`, and `z` are 1.  \n",
    "   It’s a simple way to measure “odd parity” among bits and is used to combine data unpredictably.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ch(x, y, z):**  \n",
    "   Also called the *choose* function.  \n",
    "   It picks bits from `y` or `z` depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is 1 or 0.  \n",
    "   This is a conditional operation at the bit level similar to `if (x) choose y else choose z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maj(x, y, z):**  \n",
    "   Also known as the *majority* function.  \n",
    "   For each bit position, it outputs 1 if at least two of the three inputs have that bit set.  \n",
    "   This simulates a logical majority vote for every bit position."

    "\n",
    "In this problem, we write a generator function **`block_parse(msg)`** that takes a message (as a `bytes` object) and outputs **512-bit (64-byte) blocks**, exactly the way SHA-256 expects them.  \n",
    "Because SHA-256 can *only* process messages in fixed-size 512-bit chunks, we must follow the **official padding rules** from the Secure Hash Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, it helps to break down the padding process into simple steps with clear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simplest terms Imagine you have a message of different lengths, but SHA-256 works best when the message is a certain size (512 bits). So, if your message is too short, you add some extra bits to make it the right size. Think of it like adding extra spaces at the end of a sentence to fill a whole page. https://medium.com/@bajrang1081siyag/how-sha-256-works-4951088ab9f8\n",

    "- A `hash(current, block)` function that processes a single 512-bit block\n",
    "- This follows Section 6.2.2 \"SHA-256 Hash Computation\" on page 22 of the Secure Hash Standard\n",

    "\n",
    "Reaching this point I think it is a good idea to refelect on the previous problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem 1** gave us the bitwise functions (Ch, Maj, Σ, σ) needed for compression\n",
    "- **Problem 2** gave us the 64 round constants (K) derived from cube roots\n",
    "- **Problem 3** gave us properly padded 512-bit blocks to process\n",
    "- **Problem 4** uses all of these to compute the actual hash values\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash function performs 64 rounds of operations on each block, mixing the data with constants and previous hash values to produce a new hash state. This is the heart of SHA-256's security small changes in input produce completely different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For background on how SHA-256's compression function works, this visual tool [Understanding SHA-256: A Visual Guide](https://sha256algorithm.com/) provides helpful visualizations of the process we're implementing here."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Everything Tied Together:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem 1 (Bitwise Operations)** — We built the molecular-level building blocks: Ch, Maj, and the Σ/σ functions. These simple operations on individual bits create the foundation for cryptographic strength. Think of these as the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Problem 2 (Round Constants)** — We generated the 64 constants from cube roots of primes. By deriving constants from well-known mathematical values, the SHA-256 designers proved these weren't chosen to hide backdoors. Anyone can verify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Problem 3 (Message Padding)** — We learned how to prepare any message for processing by breaking it into uniform 512-bit blocks. This padding scheme ensures that even tiny messages get properly mixed, and the length encoding prevents length-extension attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Problem 4 (Hash Computation)** — We brought it all together: the bitwise functions manipulate data, the round constants add mathematical variety, the padded blocks feed in sequentially, and 64 rounds of compression create a final digest that's practically impossible to reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The elegance of SHA-256's Design:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes SHA-256 elegant is how **simple components create complex security**. Each individual piece (a rotation, an XOR, a majority function) is trivial to compute, yet when combined through 64 rounds across multiple blocks, they create a one-way function with remarkable properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avalanche effect**: Flip one input bit → approximately 50% of output bits flip\n",
    "- **Collision resistance**: Finding two messages with the same hash requires ~2¹²⁸ attempts\n",
    "- **Pre-image resistance**: Given a hash, finding the original message requires ~2²⁵⁶ attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting Research and Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hardware Acceleration**\n",
    "Modern CPUs include SHA extensions (Intel SHA-NI, ARM Crypto Extensions) that compute SHA-256 blocks in just a few clock cycles. Projects like [Bitcoin mining ASICs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison) pushed SHA-256 hardware to extreme efficiency modern miners compute trillions of hashes per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Parallel SHA-256**\n",
    "Because each 512-bit block depends on the previous hash output, SHA-256 seems inherently sequential. However, researchers have developed clever tree-based approaches for hashing large files in parallel. The idea: split the file into chunks, hash them independently, then hash the results together in a Merkle tree structure. This is used in systems like [Git's object storage](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) and blockchain technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Quantum Resistance**\n",
    "While SHA-256 is vulnerable to Grover's algorithm (reducing security from 2²⁵⁶ to 2¹²⁸ operations on a quantum computer), it's still considered quantum-resistant for hash functions since 2¹²⁸ remains infeasible. Research into post-quantum signatures often still relies on SHA-256 as a building block. See NIST's [Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Differential Cryptanalysis**\n",
    "Researchers continuously probe SHA-256 for weaknesses. While full SHA-256 (64 rounds) remains secure, reduced-round versions have been attacked. In 2008, researchers broke 24-round SHA-256, demonstrating why those 64 rounds matter. This ongoing research validates the design minor changes would weaken it significantly. [Cryptanalysis of SHA-2 (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Cryptanalysis_and_validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Interesting Implementations**\n",
    "People have implemented SHA-256 in unexpected places:\n",
    "- **In SQL queries** — [computing SHA-256 purely with SQL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6713725/is-there-a-sha-256-implementation-in-sql) using bitwise operators\n",
    "- **In Excel** — Spreadsheet formulas can compute SHA-256, though it's very slow\n",
    "- **In Conway's Game of Life** — Theoretically possible since Game of Life is Turing-complete\n",
    "- **As a physical puzzle** — [SHA-256 solved by hand](https://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html) by Ken Shirriff, who computed a Bitcoin hash manually (took 16 minutes per hash)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding SHA-256 from first principles did more for me than teach cryptography, it revealed how **complexity emerges from simplicity**. The same patterns appear everywhere in computer science: simple rules, repeated many times, create powerful emergent behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "From blockchain consensus mechanisms to password storage to Git version control, SHA-256 secures much of our digital infrastructure. By building it ourselves, we've demystified one of computing's most important black boxes.\n",
