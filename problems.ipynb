    "\n",
    "While researching how cryptographic hash functions work, I came across an article called [*Cryptography Hash Method MD2 (Message Digest 2) – Step-by-Step Explanation Made Easy with Python*](https://nickthecrypt.medium.com/cryptography-hash-method-md2-message-digest-2-step-by-step-explanation-made-easy-with-python-10faa2e35e85) by Nick The Crypt. Although that article focuses on the older MD2 algorithm, it helped me understand the overall logic behind hash functions how they mix and transform bits to make outputs unpredictable. MD2 and SHA-256 are quite different in their design (MD2 uses substitution tables, while SHA-256 relies on logical operations and rotations), but the core idea of achieving diffusion and non-reversibility is the same. Reading it gave me a better appreciation for why SHA-256 uses helper functions like `Ch`, `Maj`, and the Σ/σ functions I implemented here.\n"

    "The functions below form the mathematical backbone of cryptographic hash algorithms like SHA-256.  \n",
    "They rely on **bitwise operations** that manipulate the binary representation of 32-bit integers to create diffusion (mixing of input bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **_rotr(x, n):**  \n",
    "   This function performs a *bitwise rotation* of a 32-bit integer `x` to the right by `n` positions.  \n",
    "   Unlike a normal shift, the bits that “fall off” on the right side are wrapped around to the left side.  \n",
    "   This operation preserves all bits while changing their order an important property for reversible bit mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parity(x, y, z):**  \n",
    "   This computes the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of three values.  \n",
    "   Each bit in the result is 1 if an odd number of corresponding bits among `x`, `y`, and `z` are 1.  \n",
    "   It’s a simple way to measure “odd parity” among bits and is used to combine data unpredictably.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ch(x, y, z):**  \n",
    "   Also called the *choose* function.  \n",
    "   It picks bits from `y` or `z` depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is 1 or 0.  \n",
    "   This is a conditional operation at the bit level similar to `if (x) choose y else choose z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maj(x, y, z):**  \n",
    "   Also known as the *majority* function.  \n",
    "   For each bit position, it outputs 1 if at least two of the three inputs have that bit set.  \n",
    "   This simulates a logical majority vote for every bit position."
