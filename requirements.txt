#The notebook is quite lean in terms of dependencies since SHA-256 implementation relies 
#primarily on bitwise operations and NumPy's uint32 type. I specified numpy>=1.21.0 to 
#ensure compatibility with modern Python versions.

#hashlib - Standard library for hash verification no install needed
#warnings - Standard library for managing warnings no install needed

numpy>=1.21.0
