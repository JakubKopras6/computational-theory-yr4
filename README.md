# Computational Theory – Year 4

This repository contains my work for the **Computational Theory** module.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate practical understanding of cryptographic concepts particularly the **SHA-256 standard** through Python implementations, logical reasoning, and well-documented Jupyter notebooks.


## 📘 Overview

The main file in this repository is the **`problems.ipynb`** notebook, which contains my solutions to a series of cryptography related programming problems.  
Each problem is introduced with a Markdown explanation, followed by clean, well commented Python code and logical reasoning for each step.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Develop clear and reproducible Python code for a variety of cryptographic and computing problems.
- Explain the logic behind cryptographic functions (especially those used in SHA-256).
- Show consistent progress and understanding throughout the semester.
- Show self learning, research and motivation throughout the semester. 


## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project folder in **VS Code**, **JupyterLab**, or **Google Colab**.
3. Open the file called **`problems.ipynb`**.
4. Run the cells in order from top to bottom to reproduce the results.
