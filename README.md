# Computational Theory – Year 4

This repository contains my work for the **Computational Theory** module.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate practical understanding of cryptographic concepts particularly the **SHA-256 standard** through Python implementations, logical reasoning, and well-documented Jupyter notebooks.


## 📘 Overview

The main file in this repository is the **`problems.ipynb`** notebook, which contains my solutions to a series of cryptography related programming problems.  
Each problem is introduced with a Markdown explanation, followed by clean, well commented Python code and logical reasoning for each step.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Develop clear and reproducible Python code for a variety of cryptographic and computing problems.
- Explain the logic behind cryptographic functions (especially those used in SHA-256).
- Show consistent progress and understanding throughout the semester.
- Show self learning, research and motivation throughout the semester. 


## 🔒 Secure Hash Standard (SHA)

A big part of this repository revolves around the **Secure Hash Standard (SHA)**, which is the official specification for cryptographic hash functions published by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). SHA-256, in particular, is the core algorithm behind many modern security systems, like SSL/TLS, digital signatures, and password hashing.  

The standard defines exactly how to transform input data into a fixed-size 256-bit hash, using a combination of bitwise operations, rotations, shifts, and mathematical constants. Understanding and implementing the functions in SHA-256 is the main focus of the notebook in this repository.  

For reference, you can check out the full document here: [NIST FIPS 180-4 Secure Hash Standard](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)
